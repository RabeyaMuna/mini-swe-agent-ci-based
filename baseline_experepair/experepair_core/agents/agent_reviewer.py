REVIEW_PROMPT_INITIAL = '''Since both the reproduction test and candidate patches may be wrong, you must comprehensively analyze both - do not judge patches solely based on test execution results.
Your task is to:
1. Evaluate the Reproduction Test:
   - For each test case, determine whether its input is valid for verifying the patch. Some test inputs might be invalid, i.e., meaning that even if the patch is correct and the issue is resolved, these tests would still produce incorrect or error outputs.
   - If a test is invalid, exclude it from consideration and do not use its result to judge the patch.
   - If valid, determine the expected correct behavior based on the issue description.
2. Evaluate Candidate Patches:
   - For each valid test input, compare the output produced by each patch against the expected correct behavior.
   - Double check: refer to the pre-patch output to confirm the issue's presence and whether it has been resolved. 
3. Score and Rank Patches:
   - Assess each candidate patch comprehensively based on the criteria below.
   - Prioritize patches by overall quality and identify those that fully resolve the core issue.

### Evaluation Criteria:
Bug Fixing Score (0-2):
   0: Incorrect: changes do not fix the issue.
   1: Partially correct: changes address some cases but are incomplete.
   2: Fully correct: changes completely fix the issue.

### Analysis Format:
<test_analysis>
  <test_case_number>[Number]</test_case_number>
  <input_valid_analysis>
    [Analysis of whether this test input is valid for issue verification]
    <decision>[valid|invalid]</decision>
  </input_valid_analysis>
</test_analysis>

<patch_analysis>
  <patch_number>[Number]</patch_number>
  <bug_fixing_analysis>
    [Analysis of whether this patch resolves the core issue]
    <score>[0-2]</score>
  </bug_fixing_analysis>
</patch_analysis>

### Patch Quality Considerations:
1. Effectiveness in resolving the core issue
2. Handling of edge cases
3. Implementation quality
4. Potential regression risks

### Final Output Format:
<rank_patch>[Ranked list of patch numbers from best to worst]</rank_patch>
<correct_patch>[List of patch numbers that are fully resolves the issue]</correct_patch>

Note:
- In the `<rank_patch>` filed, list patch numbers ordered by overall quality, e.g., [3, 1, 0, 2].
- In the `<correct_patch>` filed, include patch numbers with a **bug fixing score of 2**. If none qualify, use [].
- Ensure that your reasoning fully justifies each score and that the final rankings are logically consistent with your evaluations.

REFINE_THINK_PROMPT = """The candidate patch appears to be insufficient in fully resolving the issue, as the execution results indicate that the issue persists even after applying the patch.
Your task is to carefully analyze the patch and provide detailed, actionable suggestions for improving the patch's correctness and reliability in resolving the issue.

### Steps:
1. Review the issue description to understand the core problem and determine the expected correct behavior for each test case after the issue is resolved.
2. Examine the candidate patch to understand its intended fix strategy and how it attempts to address the issue.
3. Compare the execution results before and after applying the patch. Identify which errors, test failures, or unexpected behaviors persist and why the patch failed to resolve them.
4. For the tests that the patch failed, propose targeted and actionable suggestions:
   - You may suggest improvements to the existing patch or propose alternative fixes at different locations if necessary.
   - Suggestions must aim to make a **meaningful, functional improvement** to the candidate patch.
   - Avoid superficial changes such as documentation edits, unrelated code refactoring, or restating existing patches.
   - When possible, ensure suggestions align with the project's existing coding style and structure.

Wrap your analysis process in <patch_analysis> tags, and provide the suggestions in <patch_advice> tags.
